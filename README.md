# VSparl's dotfiles

This repo has now descended into chaos as I have set up a dual boot system on both my laptop and my desktop, resulting in mixed configs from all kinds of programs _(some Windows-only, some Linux-only, some for both)_ and out-of-date documentation. I works for me though, so the incentive to make it tidy is very small :). Maybe I'll do it one day though...

## Structure

This repo is broken down into directories for the different programs that store config files that I need accross multiple devices.
Most sections also contain a `README.md`, outlining the usage and installation of the corresponding service.

## Tweaks.md
There is one additional file in the root directory ([`tweaks.md`](./tweaks.md)) in which I store smaller things like registry edits or scripts that I found useful but don't really have a spot in their own directory.
